                    Hi, my name is Meerim. I'm currently attending Full Stack Bootcamp 'Skyzone', based in Chicago. 
                    I decided to take the leap and pursue a career in software engineering after 7 years working in geriatric homecare.
                    Just graduating from this rigorous program, I'm looking for an opportunity as junior developer.   
                    Here I have some of projects I worked on myself and my fellow students.
